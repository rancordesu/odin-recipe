            <ul>
                <li><span>1 1/2 cups of lemon juice</span></li>
                <li><span>1 1/2 cups of honey</span></li>
                <li><span>2 tablespoons of WEorcestershire sauce</span></li>
                <li><span>1 clove of garlic, minced</span></li>
                <li><span>1/4 teaspoon of dried basil</span></li>
                <li><span>4 center-cut pork chops, 1/2-inch thick</span></li>
                <li><span>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</span></li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="preparation">
            <p style="background-color: goldenrod;">This is how you do it:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><span>Mix the lemon juice, honey, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, and basil together in a bowl. Pour about half the marinade into a resealable plastic zipper bag, and place the pork chops in the bag. Squeeze out the air, seal the bag, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours (overnight is best). Refrigerate remaining marinade for basting.</span></li>
                <li><span>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</span></li>
                <li><span>Remove the chops from the bag, and discard the used marinade. Sprinkle chops with salt and black pepper. Grill the chops until browned and the meat is no longer pink inside, 20 to 25 minutes. Baste frequently with the reserved marinade, being sure to let the mixture cook onto the chops. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</span></li>
